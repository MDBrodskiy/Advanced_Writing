abstract = {Software engineering courses play an important role in computer science programs and are expected to provide the required basic knowledge and skills for professional practice in software industry. However, teaching software engineering principles, concepts and practices, and relating them to real-world scenarios are challenging tasks. The adoption of open source software projects may address such challenges. In this paper we report on an experience of the teaching object-oriented modeling with Unified Modeling Language (UML) Class Diagrams using open source projects. We conducted a case study with students of the software engineering discipline of the Computer Science course. We supported the instructor in some activities related to syllabus planning, including the selection of a Free/Libre/Open Source Software (FLOSS) projects and the creation of examples to be used in the classroom. The instructor selected and used a small FLOSS project to support the modeling activities. Then, the instructor applied an evaluation activity and a perception questionnaire about the methodology used. After the end of the classes, we conducted an interview with the instructor to present a brief report of his experience in the classroom. In the perception of students, the experience with FLOSS projects enhanced their ability to handle real projects and third-party code, and to deal with the job market. They also reported developing skills such as proactivity and communication. From the instructor's perspective, the group was enthusiastic and dynamic, and interacted more during practical activities.},

abstract = {In this paper I draw on two case studies to examine participatory learning in Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS). I contribute to prior work on learning within FLOSS and also to the learning sciences by illustrating how FLOSS supports lifelong learning and working by providing an ecosystem that allows participants to grow their knowledge of both technical and nontechnical skills over time through their association with different projects and people. I trace the learning trajectories of two participants from high school until they enter the professional workforce and beyond. I argue that FLOSS participation represents an ideal networked form of learning as it provides both socio-cognitive support for short term activities and also socio-temporal support for long term participation and learning. It is a unique form of apprenticeship that exists concurrently with formal educational experiences but unlike traditional apprenticeship experiences it succeeds by spanning different spatialities - place/space and technology mix -and temporal scales.},

abstract = {Free and/or open-source software (or F/OSS) projects now play a major and dominant role in society, constituting critical digital infrastructure relied upon by companies, academics, non-profits, activists, and more. As F/OSS has become larger and more established, we investigate the labor of maintaining and sustaining those projects at various scales. We report findings from an interview-based study with contributors and maintainers working in a wide range of F/OSS projects. Maintainers of F/OSS projects do not just maintain software code in a more traditional software engineering understanding of the term: fixing bugs, patching security vulnerabilities, and updating dependencies. F/OSS maintainers also perform complex and often-invisible interpersonal and organizational work to keep their projects operating as active communities of users and contributors. We particularly focus on how this labor of maintaining and sustaining changes as projects and their software grow and scale across many dimensions. In understanding F/OSS to be as much about maintaining a communal project as it is maintaining software code, we discuss broadly applicable considerations for peer production communities and other socio-technical systems more broadly.},

abstract = {As the amount of data we rely on every day has increased exponentially, the problem of digital archiving is becoming more and more important. People increasingly depend on having ready and easy access to the data they need to carry out their everyday lives. With this increased focus on data in everyday life comes a drastic increase in the amount of data people are responsible for. A corollary to this increasing dependence and scale is a problem we would define as digital clutter. Much like physical clutter, digital clutter can lead to confusion, complex data-management strategies, and often, unfortunate loss of important data and documents. In this paper, we present LIBRE-ary, our solution to the digital clutter and archiving problem.},
